<a name="Dir"></a>
## func [Dir](<https://github.com/0chain/gosdk/blob/doc/initial/core/pathutil/path.go#L31>)

```go
func Dir(path string) string
```

Dir returns all but the last element of path, typically the path's directory.

<a name="Join"></a>
## func [Join](<https://github.com/0chain/gosdk/blob/doc/initial/core/pathutil/path.go#L42>)

```go
func Join(elem ...string) string
```

Join joins any number of path elements into a single path, separating them with slash. Empty elements are ignored. The result is Cleaned. However, if the argument list is empty or all its elements are empty, Join returns an empty string.

<a name="Split"></a>
## func [Split](<https://github.com/0chain/gosdk/blob/doc/initial/core/pathutil/path.go#L12>)

```go
func Split(path string) (dir, file string)
```

Split splits path immediately following the final Separator, separating it into a directory and file name component. If there is no Separator in path, Split returns an empty dir and file set to path. The returned values have the property that path = dir\+file.
